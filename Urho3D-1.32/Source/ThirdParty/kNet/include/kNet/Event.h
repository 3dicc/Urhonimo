{
	EventWaitInvalid, ///< This event is uninitialized.
	EventWaitDummy, ///< The event to be waited on is a dummy event. Used to keep the index numbers straight, to avoid a O(n) pass through the whole event wait list.
	EventWaitSignal, ///< The event to be waited on is not a socket-based event, but an application-triggered signal event.

/// Event is an inter-thread synchronization primitive that can be in one of two states: Set or Cleared. 
/** A thread can avoid busy-waiting on a condition by using an Event to represent the triggering of that condition
	and calling its \ref kNet::Event::Wait "Wait()" function to observe when the condition occurs.

	Network socket read and write availability can be represented as an Event as well. The \ref kNet::EventArray 
	EventArray class can be used to wait on list of events. This allows a mixture of socket and application events to
	be handled using a single select() call.

	To create a new event, call \ref kNet::CreateNewEvent CreateNewEvent with the wait type of EventWaitSignal.

	The Event class does not follow RAII or data sharing patterns to avoid thread-safety issues. Therefore it is important
	to note that:
	- The default ctor initializes a "null" event - one that is not initialized.
	- The default copy-ctor copies the event. The two events will be the same, i.e. does not matter which of them to wait or signal.
	- The default assignment operator also copies the event, but does NOT free up the internal data used by the old event. When
	  assigning over an Event that is not needed any more, call \ref kNet::Event::Close "Close()" on that event.
	- The default destructor of an Event does NOT delete the event. Before letting the last copy of an Event go out of scope,
	  manually call \ref kNet::Event::Close "Close()" on that Event.

	This class represents a WSAEVENT on Windows, and socket or a pipe on unix. */
