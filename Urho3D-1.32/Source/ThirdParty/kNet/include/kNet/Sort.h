/** @brief A range of comparison sort algorithms.

	When to use one of these sorts and when to use the std sorts? 
		(std::sort, std::stable_sort, std::list::sort etc.)

	1)	Always consider using the standard versions first. For example, the visual c++ 
		std::sort is on average faster than the introsort described here. Additionally, 
		your code has the advantage of being more portable.

	2)	The sorting algorithms described here operate only on contiguous data. This means
		that they can only be used to sort vectors and arrays. If you have a linked 
		list, you can only use list::sort. Additionally, the data type T must be assignable.

	3) If the std:: sorting performance is not acceptable, figure out the "profile"
		of your sortable data. Is it in random or mostly sorted order? Is it sorted
		once, occasionally or on a per-frame basis? Are all items unique or are there several
		that are equivalent? Is stable sort-property required? Then look at the actual 
		implementations of these algorithms and decide what fits the data profile the best. 
		And of course, always measure the actual performance. 
		
	Note that a few of these algorithms have only been implemented as a curiosity.
	Selection sort for example just plain sucks.

	The client-implemented comparison function must be of this form:

	template<typename T>
	int CmpFunc(const T &a, const T &b);

	@param a The first comparison operand.
	@param b The second comparison operand.
	@return a negative value if a < b, 0 if a == b and a positive value when b < a. */
