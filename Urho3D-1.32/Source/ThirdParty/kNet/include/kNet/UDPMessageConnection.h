UDP packet format: 3 bytes if InOrder=false. 5-6 bytes if InOrder=true.
1bit   - InOrder packet.   This packet contains InOrder messages.
1bit   - Reliable packet.  This packet is expected to be Acked by the receiver.
6 bits - The six lowest bits of the PacketID.
u16      The 16 next bits of the PacketID. This gives 22 bits of the PacketID in total.
* u8       InOrder array length.
* N x u8-u16   InOrder PacketID delta counter. VLE-encoded 1.7/8 Only present if InOrder=true.
.Message.
.Message.
...
.Message.


Message format: 2 bytes if FRGSTART=FRAGMENT=false.
1bit - FRGSTART. This is the first fragment of the message (offset=0)
1bit - FRAGMENT. This message is a fragment of a bigger message -flag. If FRGSTART=true, this field is not read and is assumed to be true.
1bit - InOrder. This message may be processed by the application only after all the previous InOrder messages have been processed.
* 1bit - InOrder. This message may be processed by the application only after all the previous InOrder messages have been processed.
* 1bit - InOrder. This message may be processed by the application only after all the previous InOrder messages have been processed.
(Old: 1bit - Unused.)

11 bits Content length (includes both the length of MessageID and Content Data fields)
* u8 InOrder array index.                                         Only present if InOrder=7 (111 in base 2).
u8-u32 # of Fragments in whole message  VLE-encoded 1.7/1.7/16    Only present if FRGSTART=true.
u8 Fragment Transfer ID                                           Only present if FRAGMENT=true or FRGSTART=true.
