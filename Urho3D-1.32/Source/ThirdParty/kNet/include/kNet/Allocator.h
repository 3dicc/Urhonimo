/** @file Allocator.h
	@brief Provides global memory allocation routines using instance-based allocators.

	All allocators in the system are instance-based (in contrast to class-based). 
	This implies a few things:
		1. Because all memory allocation is performed through allocators, you need to create an allocator 
		   instance to be able to allocate memory.
		2. Each container will have a pointer to the allocator instance it's using.
		3. There are no general global (static/class-based/compile time -based) memory allocators.

	See http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1850.pdf for loosely related discussion
	(mainly class-based vs instance-based allocator system). An allocator must support the following concept:
	
	class Allocator
	{
	public:
		static void *Alloc(Allocator *instance, size_t size, size_t alignment, const char *nameTag = 0, AllocFlags flags = AFAllocLow);
		static void Free(Allocator *instance, void *ptr);
		static size_t Size(Allocator *instance, void *ptr);
	};

	The reason that the member functions are static, but still take in as the first parameter an instance of the Allocator
	is that this allows both class-based and instance-based allocators to be created using the same interface. */
